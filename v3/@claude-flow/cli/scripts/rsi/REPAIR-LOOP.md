# Continuing repair engineering work

Decision: build a bounded executable improver for real repository work. The
current deliverable is a working admission and historical regression calibration
tool, not a repair optimizer or evidence of recursive improvement.

## First measured calibration

Reviewed implementation and plan were published at
`642ecff20e3641545bea0d5fa3d3806d6c0e7736`, tree
`cf6b51f3de741df78b17584cfd6ac88da3172cb1`, before recording this benchmark.
The historical fixes and unit-test results were already known; this is not a
preregistered efficacy experiment or a final confirmation reservation.

Frozen plan: `278b2fcdd4be671857eb28354eafcd37b3342a5b7188a14c72594ea0e437908f`.
Raw outcomes, transformed source hashes, process stdout/stderr and costs are in
[`evidence/repair-calibration.json`](evidence/repair-calibration.json).

| Witness | Original passes | Fixed passes |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Receipt fractions | 2/5 | 5/5 |
| Decimal statistics round trip | 2/3 | 3/3 |
| Unknown receipt fields | 2/4 | 4/4 |

All three defects reproduce; all fixed checks pass. This measures the calibration
tool's ability to distinguish known source revisions, not an agent repair rate.
Six subprocesses took 314.337 ms total wall time on this Node 24 host. Parent CPU
was 168649 microseconds; measured child import/check CPU was 125151 microseconds,
excluding child startup. External provider spend was $0; full acquisition and
evaluation dollar costs remain unknown. No latency superiority is claimed from
this single benchmark. Profiling does not justify optimizing this subsecond
calibration ahead of implementing the missing improvement procedure.

There were zero mission candidate evaluations and zero new native field calls.
The mission retains seven epochs, 209784 reserved calls and head
`5a0e219e871fcf616209807c828c5793c29752f8d190fc38a0bc95e4db88422e`.
The 35 existing focused tests and 13 new tests pass. All seven historical epochs
replay using their original source. Calibration unit tests and CI reruns are
additional engineering validation, excluded from the single benchmark above.

```bash
node v3/@claude-flow/cli/scripts/rsi/repair/run.mjs replay \
  v3/@claude-flow/cli/scripts/rsi/evidence/repair-readiness-plan.json \
  278b2fcdd4be671857eb28354eafcd37b3342a5b7188a14c72594ea0e437908f
```

Expected: `regressionWitnessesVerified: true`, `ledgerUnchanged: true`,
`candidateExecutionEnabled: false`, `boundedRsiEvidenceAccepted: false`.

## Implemented and reproducible

`repair/corpus.json` contains three actual RuFlo TypeScript defects, original
parent revisions and published fixes. Exact source bytes and their dependency
closure are preserved under `repair/snapshots`, addressed by original Git blob ID.
`repair/acquisition.json` preserves the observed GitHub commit/path/blob bindings
and fix parent metadata. This is an acquisition record, not an independent signed
attestation. GitHub supplied the bytes at acquisition; offline admission verifies their Git
blob and SHA256 hashes. It does not independently query whether a remote commit
contains a blob. The immutable source URLs permit external verification.

1. Issue 3229: receipt policy fractions were serialized as binary numbers.
2. Issue 3072: statistics computed before decimal encoding could fail replay.
3. Issue 3068: unknown receipt fields were accepted despite a closed schema.

These are known repairs in one receipt module and count as **one independent
cluster**. They are calibration fixtures with exposed fixes, not representative
repair accuracy measurements, newly discovered repairs, or sealed final tasks.
The baseline means the original broken source, not an agent trying to repair it.

The fixed witness includes valid input and content tampering guards. It invokes
the complete historical module, after Node's TypeScript stripping and one explicit
relative import suffix translation. Both original and executable hashes are
recorded. The same dependency bytes came from each source revision. No extraction
of only the changed function or model simulation substitutes for native code.

No evaluator keys are created. Unsigned receipt tests inspect structural errors
while explicitly excluding the expected unsigned error. They do not demonstrate
signed receipt acceptance or independent evaluation.

The runner permits six fixed witness processes, five seconds per process, a
128 MiB V8 old space limit and 64 KiB output limit. The V8 limit is not a total
RSS bound. Each child receives a minimal environment and Node file permissions.
This is containment for reviewed historical fixtures, **not an adversarial
sandbox for arbitrary candidate code**. No arbitrary command or candidate runner
is exposed. All temporary witness files are removed after execution.

Admission binds the actual existing mission, original anchor, complete ledger
fingerprint, counters, consumed tasks, trust, protocol, source, corpus, verifier
and witness bytes. It refuses source drift, changed plans, corrupt snapshots,
unsafe paths, duplicate tasks, inflated clusters and ambiguous locks. It reads
the ledger without adding events. Fixed regression validation is engineering
work, not a new HYPOTHESIS or mission candidate evaluation.

## Required implementation sequence (operator update, 2026-09-13)

Advance the next executable comparison. At the start of each increment name the
execution blocker it removes or experimental uncertainty it resolves. At acceptance
demonstrate that change; test counts and additional manifests alone do not qualify.
Stop redundant infrastructure work. If no authorized useful work remains, preserve
state, report the exact missing input and pause the existing task. Do not create a
replacement task or ledger. The resource proposal below remains unapproved.

1. **Finish p-limit end to end.** Use the already frozen compact source, exact
   offline dependency and Node 24.19.0 witness. Finish the isolated executor and
   reproduce the historical failure and known fix in a clean environment without
   network access. A single runnable workload is a development milestone. Defer
   broader RuVector acquisition until it contributes to this comparison.
2. **Implement the smallest inherited improver.** Descendants inherit diagnosis
   rules, patch-selection logic and test-selection state. A child must produce
   and evaluate successors without additional researcher coaching. First proposed
   hypothesis: inherited training-only failure-analysis state selects more productive
   repair attempts on fresh development tasks at equal cost. This is a proposed
   hypothesis, not an admitted HYPOTHESIS event or permission to execute trials.
3. **Measure improvement capacity.** Freeze implementation, model, evaluator,
   permissions and task samples before comparing inherited state against frozen,
   static, shuffled and previous-optimizer controls. Include matched acquisition,
   execution and outer Codex treatment. Measure successor productivity on fresh
   tasks, distinguishing inheritance from a Codex-written proposer improvement.
   Exposed known fixes cannot be relabeled as fresh or sealed tasks.
4. **Derive publication and costs from validated evidence.** Generate report and
   Federation identities from the same checked artifact and verify public readback.
   Include failures, interruptions, acquisition, model use, process starts and time;
   distinguish spawn attempts from observed starts and unmeasured descendants.
   Unknown costs remain explicitly unknown and block confirmation.
5. **Run bounded development, then independent confirmation.** Complete reviewed
   migration and resource authorization, bind reviewed source in HYPOTHESIS and
   reserve durably before at most three development epochs, twelve candidates each.
   Preserve all failures and lifetime native units. Confirmation still requires
   three families, three generations, four controls, two approved evaluators, sealed
   fresh workloads, complete dollar costs and the unchanged 72-cell/alpha protocol.
   Independently accepted and externally replicated bounded evidence is required
   before declaring success. Z3/Lean may check explicit correctness invariants;
   they cannot establish empirical generalization.

Research grounding, verified 2026-09-13: [Hyperagents v1, submitted 2026-03-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.19461v1)
distinguishes the task agent from an editable mechanism that modifies agents.
Its meta-level transfer findings are author-reported, not reproduced here.
The [official implementation at 59a68f67, dated 2026-04-14](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Hyperagents/tree/59a68f672dfb92c74aeb7e61535d776fb36e172d)
separates task_agent.py, meta_agent.py and generate_loop.py. No code or paid
execution from that repository is used in this increment.

## Existing artifacts and admission requirements

[WORKLOADS-006.md](WORKLOADS-006.md) provides an executable offline historical
p-limit runtime witness, using exact yocto-queue 1.2.1 payloads and Node 24.19.0.
It has durable engineering reservations and raw process outcomes. Full upstream
tests, hidden tests, arbitrary candidate isolation and resource approval remain
missing. The host denied Bubblewrap network namespace setup; do not treat the
fixed witness's Node permissions as an arbitrary candidate sandbox.

[EXECUTOR-001.md](EXECUTOR-001.md) preserves the first Bubblewrap contract and
negative receipts. [EXECUTOR-002.md](EXECUTOR-002.md) corrects its probe trust
boundary, interrupted reservation handling and overstated isolation verdict.
[EXECUTOR-003.md](EXECUTOR-003.md) binds the pinned Node, prlimit and ELF loader
identities and adds the two exact synthetic /lib links inside the empty root.
This removes the known loader-layout defect from the launch construction.
[EXECUTOR-004.md](EXECUTOR-004.md) adds direct bounded ELF dynamic-section
parsing and validates the complete declared static eight-library dependency closure,
including exact SONAME, symlink, canonical path, direct dependency and search-path
properties plus reviewed file hashes. Data-driven loads, immutable runtime
snapshotting, pinned Bubblewrap identity, actual relocation, sandbox startup and
OS isolation still require a compatible runner. [EXECUTOR-005.md](EXECUTOR-005.md)
stages only that declared closure into a private content-addressed tree, validates
its exact inventory immediately before launch construction, and removes the
whole-host `/usr` bind. It does not claim immutability against a privileged parent.
A host compatibility receipt cannot grant resource authority.
[EXECUTOR-006.md](EXECUTOR-006.md) replaces unbounded pathname file reads with
bounded `O_NOFOLLOW` descriptor reads, stable descriptor identity checks, and a
final snapshot revalidation immediately before the fixed probe spawn. It also
pins Bubblewrap 0.9.0 by exact hash and size, stages an owned private executable,
and revalidates it immediately before spawn rather than invoking the host path.
Validation is not atomically bound to pathname-based exec or mounts; engine,
probe, snapshot and cleanup paths are not claimed safe against a hostile same-UID
process. Attempted-but-unobserved spawns remain charged and explicitly unknown;
candidate execution remains disabled.
Do not rerun the incompatible host unchanged.
[EXECUTOR-007.md](EXECUTOR-007.md) records that the pinned Bubblewrap 0.9.0
canonicalizes ordinary `/proc/self/fd/N` bind sources back to pathnames and thus
cannot close the mount race. Production now fails before spawn unless reviewed
native `--[ro-]bind-fd` semantics are present. This also prevents leaking ordinary
inherited directory descriptors into the eventual sandbox command. The prepared
v0.10-compatible path uses native fd binds for directories, fd-data for the fixed
probe, descriptor execution for the engine, and detects a stale snapshot-root
replacement before pathname-recursive cleanup. Concurrent cleanup replacement
remains an exclusive-UID-runner requirement. It
deliberately does not claim protection against hostile same-UID
in-place mutation, ptrace, signals or output tampering. An exclusive-UID compatible
runner, a separately reviewed and pinned Bubblewrap 0.10.0-or-later executable,
and successful mount/namespace/egress probe remain required before p-limit or any
repair candidate execution.

[EXECUTOR-008.md](EXECUTOR-008.md) rejects the previously selected Bubblewrap
0.10.0 because the official GHSA-pxhw-h44j-8pfx advisory affects versions before
0.12.0. It builds and preserves a quarantined v0.12.0 artifact from the exact
official release source, records all observed duplicate acquisition work without
refund, and adds a single-use acquisition guard. The artifact is not yet a trusted
runtime: its build provenance, toolchain reproducibility and compatible-host
isolation behavior remain unproved.

[EXECUTOR-009.md](EXECUTOR-009.md) migrates the executor policy to schema v2 and
binds it to that exact repository artifact, hash, size, ELF closure, upstream
source identities and reviewed native fd semantics. The executor derives the
artifact path from its own reviewed source root, validates the complete policy,
requires exact `bubblewrap 0.12.0` output and rejects
`--not-a-security-boundary`. Upstream source confirms `--ro-bind-fd` performs a
post-mount device/inode identity check and `--ro-bind-data` copies from an
inherited fd. That check does not prevent hostile same-UID in-place content
mutation, so only the fixed capability probe can be attempted next, and only on
a compatible exclusive-UID host. This source review does not authorize a probe,
p-limit run, repair trial, merge or deployment.

[EXECUTOR-010.md](EXECUTOR-010.md) reproduces and fixes a pre-launch FIFO hang
in descriptor validation. Both engine and probe FIFOs timed out on original
source and reject before the callback on fixed source using O_NONBLOCK plus
the existing regular-file check. Read-only O_NOFOLLOW alone does not prevent
FIFO opens from blocking. Preserve this regression when changing admission;
it is not proof of general filesystem time bounds or OS isolation.

[EXECUTOR-011.md](EXECUTOR-011.md) applies the same measured lesson to the shared
bounded-file reader used by executor and runtime admission. A real FIFO blocks
the published baseline before fstat and rejects on the corrected source. Every
untrusted bounded regular-file admission path must retain O_NONBLOCK before its
regular-file check. This closes the reproduced FIFO case only; it does not prove
same-UID immutability, general filesystem time bounds or OS isolation.

[LOOP-GUIDANCE-002.md](LOOP-GUIDANCE-002.md) makes focused-test registration
fail closed after EXECUTOR-011 retained a green CI run that omitted its new suite.
Every regular repair test file must have exactly one direct executable reference
in the bounded-RSI workflow. The coverage audit runs before the remaining repair
suites and rejects missing, duplicate or merely commented references. Do not
bypass this guard to obtain green CI; it improves validation integrity, not agent
productivity or RSI evidence.

[FRESH-ADMISSION-001.md](FRESH-ADMISSION-001.md) introduces a separate,
metadata-only fresh-development task type. It binds the current mission ancestry
and all six known calibration/exposed task IDs plus eleven base/fix revisions as
mandatory exclusions. Exact schemas reject fix, patch, outcome or training-trace
fields; provenance must state that no fix or outcome was acquired, and evaluator
capsules must be frozen before proposal and unread by the proposer. The current
freeze intentionally contains zero real tasks. Synthetic admission tests prove
only the guard's mechanics. Do not call a task fresh until a reviewed public
source archive and parent-only evaluator capsule satisfy this validator; this
guard provides no isolation, resource authority, efficacy or RSI evidence.

[FRESH-FREEZE-002.md](FRESH-FREEZE-002.md) admits the first real development
task after a fixed pre-outcome GitHub search: avoid-ai-writing issue 291 at its
exact older base commit and tree. The complete runnable four-file source closure, parent-
only four-case evaluator and test plan are byte-bound and checked for bounded,
safe archive paths. The issue statement is exposed task input; no fix revision,
patch or candidate outcome was acquired. Its base 1/4 result is task calibration,
not a repair evaluation. The public evaluator is reviewer-visible but must be
withheld from the proposer input and mount. Reject or roll back the task if the
issue closes, a solution becomes exposed before proposal, content binding fails,
or runtime separation cannot be enforced. One admitted task does not authorize
execution or establish improvement capacity.

[FRESH-STAGE-001.md](FRESH-STAGE-001.md) applies the first measured lesson from
that freeze: validating parent-only metadata is insufficient unless the child
surface is constructed separately. Before any proposer starts, validate source,
evaluator and test-plan bytes in the parent, create a new source-only workspace,
and give the child only the source receipt. Evaluator paths, hashes and bytes must
remain in a distinct parent binding. Reject reused destinations, non-regular tar
entries, unsafe paths, duplicate entries and unsupported metadata; stage fixed
read-only modes instead of archive-supplied permissions. This source staging is
not OS isolation: the compatible exclusive-UID sandbox, resource approval and a
separate child launch remain mandatory. Roll back the staged task if any parent
evaluator identity reaches the proposer surface or workspace.

[FRESH-PROMPT-001.md](FRESH-PROMPT-001.md) closes the next child-autonomy gap:
source bytes alone do not tell a child what change to attempt. Freeze the exact
public issue statement as a bounded proposer-visible capsule before proposal,
bind its repository, issue URL, state, timestamps, zero-comment observation and
base revision, and validate it before building the child surface. The task prompt
may cross the proposer boundary; evaluator and test-plan identities may not.
Reject altered or unbounded prompt bytes, closed/commented task observations,
unknown fields and fix/outcome provenance. A public issue can expose strong hints,
so this is development input rather than sealed confirmation data. It gives a
future child a task without researcher follow-up; it does not execute that child,
prove isolation, authorize resources or measure descendant improvement.

[FRESH-IMPROVER-ADMISSION-001.md](FRESH-IMPROVER-ADMISSION-001.md) preserves a
useful negative before trial authorization: the current inherited and control
materializer is exactly bound to the exposed p-limit task, base revision and
`index.js`, while the frozen fresh task is a different repository, revision and
regex-line-boundary cluster. All five arms therefore have zero admitted proposal
families for the fresh task. Do not generate placeholder candidates or reinterpret
training-only templates as cross-task improvement. Admit a future trial only after
a reviewed task-general proposer or an independently frozen compatible training
lineage passes this exact source-binding gate. This check does not read a fresh
outcome, run a child, authorize resources or establish RSI.

[TASK-GENERAL-PROPOSER-ADMISSION-001.md](TASK-GENERAL-PROPOSER-ADMISSION-001.md)
adds a source-derived operator registry for the first frozen fresh task without
overwriting the p-limit-specific negative. Derive generic operator availability
only from the frozen public task prompt and proposer-visible source; keep evaluator
inputs and fresh outcomes parent-only. Report the entire availability gain as a
Codex-written proposer effect: the inherited p-limit state contributes zero to
admission or selection. Every arm must receive equal mechanics, and candidate
descriptor creation, patch materialization and execution remain closed until a
reviewed hypothesis, compatible isolation and the separate resource approval.

[IMPROVER-001.md](IMPROVER-001.md) implements an engineering-only inherited
ranking scaffold while the compatible isolation runner is unavailable. Five
nominal arms use one deterministic mechanism to derive diagnosis, patch-family
and test-selection state and emit successor descriptors from the exposed p-limit
training trace; generation-zero `previous` explicitly degenerates with `frozen`.
No patch bytes or repository candidates execute, so training-fit rankings are not
fresh-task improvement-capacity evidence, do not remove the executable-repair
proposer blocker and admit no hypothesis.

[IMPROVER-002.md](IMPROVER-002.md) adds a bounded exposed-template patch
materializer. The inherited child turns its top descriptor into a replayable
single-replacement artifact and exactly reconstructs the published p-limit fix in
memory without receiving the fix fixture path. It reads a researcher-authored
grammar derived from the exposed fix; direct fixture reads are not syscall-audited. The grammar is
that exposed fix and only the inherited arm has template coverage; this is not
autonomous synthesis, matched-control comparison, repository execution or RSI
evidence. Candidate execution remains disabled.

[IMPROVER-003.md](IMPROVER-003.md) gives inherited and all four controls the
same two-descriptor-to-two-artifact materialization mechanism. Four frozen,
researcher-authored templates cover every proposal family; duplicate candidates
and generation-zero control degeneracy are preserved. This removes unequal patch
availability. Parent recomputation work and bounded input reads are charged
separately, while failed child starts retain unknown work. It does not equalize byte costs, execute candidates, read fresh-task
outcomes or measure improvement capacity. Candidate execution remains disabled.

[MIGRATION-001.md](MIGRATION-001.md) records the implemented versioned projection
and reservation algebra, adversarial tests and a concrete resource authorization
proposal. Live application, durable version dispatch and candidate execution
remain disabled. Read that increment before repeating accounting design work.

**Accounting and source migration.** The v1 ledger only accepts retrieval
   policies and native BM25 calls. Design a versioned migration retaining its
   exact history, 209784 consumed native calls, 7 epochs, alpha, tasks, trust and
   gates. Repair executions cannot spend a relabeled native call budget. State
   any required additional resource dimensions and obtain the applicable
   approval before enabling them. Merely reviewing this adapter does not enable
   optimization. Preserve original source snapshots and test mixed-version replay,
   interrupted reservations and retained charges. Do not invent zero acquisition
   costs. The current adapter always reports execution disabled.
**Preserved broader public development tasks.** [WORKLOADS-001.md](WORKLOADS-001.md)
   freezes the first three exact public base/fix lineages and fail-closed
   admission checks. Complete source archives, offline dependency closures,
   toolchains and hidden development tests remain missing, so candidate
   execution stays disabled. [WORKLOADS-002.md](WORKLOADS-002.md) mirrors all 23
   manifest-bound changed source, upstream test, license and package-manifest
   blobs with offline Git-object verification, while explicitly refusing to
   treat that partial capsule as a whole source tree or runnable environment.
   [WORKLOADS-003.md](WORKLOADS-003.md) freezes all 12354 base-tree path,
   mode, type and object-id entries and reconstructs both base and one-commit
   fix tree identities offline. Inventories prove whole-tree identity, but do
   not contain every blob payload or make the workloads executable.
   [WORKLOADS-004.md](WORKLOADS-004.md) adds complete content-addressed base
   and fix source payloads for the compact p-limit and Click workloads. The
   larger RuVector payload set and every offline dependency closure remain
   deliberately deferred, so candidate execution remains disabled.
   [WORKLOADS-005.md](WORKLOADS-005.md) preserves the complete 169-blob local
   source closure for the RuVector graph target and its two direct path-dependency
   crates. It also freezes an object-size inventory showing that the unrelated
   full workspace is 316496519 referenced bytes; that larger acquisition remains
   separately gated and no runnable dependency closure is claimed.
   These artifacts remain preserved; broader acquisition is deferred in favor of
   the p-limit comparison above. Record exclusions, fix exposure, dependencies
   and costs when further task acquisition becomes relevant. Freeze samples
   before comparing methods. The known witnesses cannot become final data.

The separate initial repair resource proposal is **not approved**: at most
36 candidate evaluations, 216 isolated process starts and 1080000 summed process
wall milliseconds across at most three existing shared epochs. No local helper,
review of this document or capability result authorizes that envelope. Retain
209784 native BM25 calls, seven epochs, original ancestry, consumed tasks,
trust, lifetime alpha and every existing proof gate.

Each continuing run completes one useful bounded engineering increment in the
existing draft PR, updates Core Memory issue 85 and releases its Federation claim.
Avoid repeating an unchanged calibration or failed hypothesis. If useful work
is fully blocked, preserve state and report the exact missing input; never create
new counters or expand budgets. No autonomous merge, release or deployment.

## Local acceptance

```bash
node --test v3/@claude-flow/cli/scripts/rsi/repair/repair.test.mjs
```

Expected: thirteen passing tests, three witnessed historical defects, fixed sources
passing, unchanged original mission bytes and candidate execution disabled.
Frozen calibration plans and measured raw output live beside the original
evidence, not in a replacement mission ledger. Timings include parent work and
subprocess wall time; child CPU measures import and checks, excluding startup.
Total acquisition and evaluation dollars remain unknown, despite no external
provider spend. Neither passing tests nor two copies of these results establish
RSI or independent efficacy.
