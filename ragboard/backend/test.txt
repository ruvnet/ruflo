This is a test document for RAG pipeline testing.

The document contains sample text about artificial intelligence and machine learning.
AI systems can process natural language and generate human-like responses.
Vector databases enable semantic search across large document collections.

Key concepts:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Embeddings and vector similarity
- Document chunking and processing
- ChromaDB for vector storage

This text will be processed, chunked, and stored as embeddings for testing the RAG functionality.
