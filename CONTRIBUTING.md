# Contributing to This Fork

Thanks for helping improve this project.

This repository is a community-maintained fork of [ruvnet/claude-flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow). We keep this fork active to match our own maintenance and release cadence.

Please follow our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all project spaces.

## Community Principles

- Respect upstream maintainers and contributors
- Preserve attribution, license, and project history
- Focus discussion on code and outcomes, never on people
- Prefer transparent decisions in issues and pull requests

## Contribution Workflow

1. Open an issue first for non-trivial changes.
2. Keep pull requests focused and reasonably small.
3. Include tests or validation steps for behavior changes.
4. Update docs when behavior, flags, or commands change.
5. Add clear context in the PR description:
   - What changed
   - Why it changed
   - How it was validated
   - Whether it should be proposed upstream

## Upstream Relationship

- We regularly sync from upstream.
- If a fix is generally useful, mark it as an upstream candidate in the PR.
- Fork-specific behavior should be documented explicitly.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions are released under the same license as this repository (`MIT`).
