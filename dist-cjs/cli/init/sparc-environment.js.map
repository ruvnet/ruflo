Multiple AI Agents for Complex Features\n\nUse swarm mode when building complex features that benefit from multiple specialized agents:\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n# Example: Building a complete e-commerce platform\n./claude-flow swarm \"Build complete e-commerce platform with payment integration\" \\\\\n  --strategy development --parallel --max-agents 8\n\n# Example: Adding real-time features to YOUR app\n./claude-flow swarm \"Add real-time chat and notifications to my app\" \\\\\n  --strategy development --parallel --max-agents 5\n\n# Example: Comprehensive testing of YOUR application\n./claude-flow swarm \"Create comprehensive test suite for my API\" \\\\\n  --strategy testing --parallel --max-agents 6\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## \uD83D\uDCBB Code Style for YOUR Project\n\nWhen Claude Code writes code for YOUR application, it will follow these best practices:\n- Modern ES6+ JavaScript/TypeScript\n- Clean, readable code with proper naming\n- Comprehensive error handling\n- Security best practices\n- Performance optimization\n- Proper documentation\n\n## \uD83D\uDEA8 Important Reminders\n\n### \u2705 DO Use Claude-Flow For:\n- Building YOUR new application\n- Adding features to YOUR project\n- Writing tests for YOUR code\n- Debugging YOUR application\n- Optimizing YOUR performance\n- Documenting YOUR project\n\n### \u274C DON'T Use Claude-Flow For:\n- Modifying the claude-flow system itself\n- Changing how claude-flow works internally\n- Updating claude-flow commands or features\n- Fixing claude-flow bugs (report them on GitHub instead)\n\n## \uD83C\uDF89 Get Started Building YOUR Application!\n\nRemember: Claude-flow is a TOOL to help you build YOUR application faster and better. Focus on describing what YOU want to build, and let the AI agents help you create it.\n\n**Example first command for a new project:**\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n./claude-flow sparc \"Create a [YOUR APP TYPE] application with [YOUR MAIN FEATURES]\"\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nHappy coding! \uD83D\uDE80\n`;\n}\n"],
