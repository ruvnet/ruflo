 *   `queued` (the engine runs a submit made during a turn as a turn of its own once the session is idle) and the submit is still made, once.
 * - It is screened by the same AIDefence screen as a typed question to Claude (`screenText`, unless the person switched the screen off): a
 *   secret-shaped or unsafe message is refused and nothing is submitted. A message over the screen's limit could not be screened whole, so it
 *   is refused too.
 * - `pending` returns to `idle` when the submit settles. That is the one signal tied to this very message, it is the same for success and
 *   failure, and it needs no hook of its own. A refusal, a rejection, or a hook's `{ drop }` leaves a fixed `sendError` (never the message,
 *   never the engine's or the hook's reason), which stays until the next send starts.
 * - The text is kept nowhere but the field's own draft (in memory, beside the store): not in the store, an event, the last outcome or an
 *   error. An accepted send empties the draft (unless the person has typed something else meanwhile); a refused one keeps it. Never throws.
