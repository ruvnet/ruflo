# Two-stage review process for completed tasks
type: beads-reviewer
version: "3.0.0"
description: |
  Performs rigorous two-stage review of completed tasks.
  Stage 1: Spec compliance - validates implementation against requirements.
  Stage 2: Code quality - checks security, tests, patterns, performance.
  Does NOT trust implementer's self-report; reads actual code.

capabilities:
  - spec-compliance-review
  - code-quality-review
  - security-analysis
  - test-coverage-check
  - pattern-validation
  - performance-review
