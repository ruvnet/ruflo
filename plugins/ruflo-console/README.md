# ruflo-console

ruflo's cockpit inside Claude Code: the `/ruflo` command, its pages, and a band above the prompt. It reads ruflo's own files; anything it cannot measure reads `n/a`. Design notes: ADR-407 (cockpit), ADR-448 (the Room), ADR-446 (plugin mods).

## Drive the console from the command line

`scripts/drive.sh` runs the console through its own model tools (`console_open`, `console_state`, `console_set`, `console_run`) from a real headless Claude, prints what each tool answered, and can assert on it, so a dev loop or CI job can check that a UI shows something.

```bash
RUFLO_E2E_LIVE=1 bash plugins/ruflo-console/scripts/drive.sh \
  --expect 'Waiting for a yes' \
  "$PWD/plugins/ruflo-console" read "Open the Room and quote back what is waiting for a yes."
```

Output is one `CALL <tool> <input>` and one `RESULT <tool> <text>` line per console call (each result cut at 4000 characters), then `COST <usd> CALLS <n>`, then one `EXPECT ok|FAIL /regex/` line per `--expect`.

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | a console call ran and every `--expect` matched (or the run was skipped, see below) |
| 1 | no console tool call ran |
| 2 | usage error: bad level or an invalid `--expect` regex |
| 3 | at least one `--expect` regex (case-insensitive, repeatable) matched no `RESULT` |
| 4 | `CONSOLE_DRIVE_INSTALL` was set and the marketplace add or install failed |

- **What it spends:** about $0.10 per run with haiku, hard-capped at $0.40 (`--max-budget-usd`). Use one to three runs, not a sweep.
- **Isolated config:** the run uses a throwaway `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` seeded with the level you ask for and confirm mode `auto` (your login is copied 0600 and shredded on exit), because `RUFLO_CONSOLE_CONTROL` can only lower the saved setting (ADR-450 T12) and your own saved mode would otherwise decide what a drive does.
- **Why the level is capped:** the level is `read`, `write` or `manage`; `full` is rejected (exit 2). The run happens in a scratch project (`mktemp -d`), with Bash, Write and Edit disallowed, so a drive can never spend money or delete anything.
- **Seeding:** `CONSOLE_DRIVE_SEED=<dir>` copies that directory into the scratch `.claude-flow/` first, for example a `claims/claims.json` to assert the claims view shows it.
- **Skips cleanly:** without `RUFLO_E2E_LIVE=1` or a `claude` binary (on `PATH` or `$CLAUDE_BIN`) it prints `SKIP` and exits 0, so it is safe to call from CI.
- **Extra plugins:** any further arguments are added as `--plugin-dir`. That loads a plugin but does not install it, so `claude plugin configure` cannot see it.
- **Installed plugin (for option rows):** `CONSOLE_DRIVE_INSTALL=<marketplace-dir>:<plugin>@<marketplace>` registers that directory as a marketplace and installs the plugin (user scope) inside the throwaway config only, then runs the drive; the Settings view can then read the plugin's options. Your real `~/.claude/plugins` and saved console settings are never touched, and `claude plugin update` is never run. Prints `INSTALLED <id>`; a bad value exits 2, a failed install exits 4.

```bash
CONSOLE_DRIVE_INSTALL="$PWD:ruflo-mods@ruflo" RUFLO_E2E_LIVE=1 bash plugins/ruflo-console/scripts/drive.sh \
  --expect 'Hide unused agent types' "$PWD/plugins/ruflo-console" read "Open view settings with chip mods, then console_state, and quote the ruflo-mods option rows."
```

## Your project's ADRs (ADR-480)

**TOOLS → ADRs** manages the Architecture Decision Records of the project you run Claude Code in (not ruflo's own).

- **Finding them.** The console looks for `docs/adr`, `docs/adrs`, `doc/adr`, `adr`, `docs/architecture/decisions`, `docs/decisions` and `architecture/decisions`, or the folder in *Settings → ADR folder*. A folder that is a link is never read. With none, **initialise ADRs here** asks first, then creates the folder and `0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`; nothing is overwritten.
- **Reading them.** MADR front matter, Nygard / adr-tools `## Status` sections (`Superseded by [5. …](0005-….md)`), ruflo-style `Status:` lines, log4brains and plain markdown with no status all parse; a file that does not parse still lists. Filter by status, words and scope; the detail shows links both ways, the decision, and the missions it is attached to; the health strip is the lint.
- **Writing them.** *propose* takes the next number and the style your ADRs already use (override in Settings: ADR style, ADR file name pattern). Accept, reject, deprecate or supersede from a record's detail. Each shows the exact file and the diff, writes only that on your Yes, and leaves a file that changed since alone.
- **Missions, loops, swarms.** Attach ADRs to the active mission (the page suggests some from the goal's words; you decide). Claude's mission context, each task's instruction and spawned swarm agents (ruflo-swarm 0.3.5) are told the accepted decisions, masked and capped. At *verify*, changed files are compared with the paths the attached accepted ADRs name: a warning in the mission record. **That compares paths only. It does not prove a change follows or breaks a decision, and it never blocks.** When a mission is done, *draft an ADR from this mission* prepares a proposed record from its goal and tasks; the decision is yours to write.
- **For Claude.** `/ruflo run adr-propose <title>`, `adr-accept <n>`, `adr-supersede <old> <new>`, `adr-attach <n>` and the rest are palette entries, so Claude reaches them through `console_run` at the *write* control level (reading the page is *read*); a change still waits for your Yes on the diff.

## Toasts (ADR-477)

Settings → Interface and updates → **Toasts** sets what the ruflo plugins may show over the transcript: `all`, `important` (warnings and errors) or `off`, with a mute chip each for `console`, `swarm`, `protector` and `mods`. It is kept in the console's store and mirrored to `.claude-flow/console/toast-prefs.json`, which the other plugins read. Every toast, drawn or not, becomes an event on the Events page (`toast <source> <glyph> <text> [off|muted|deduped|…]`); the other plugins' digests are read from `.claude-flow/console/toasts/<source>.jsonl`, masked and capped. The console itself also toasts a mission that finishes (`ok`) or loses a task (`error`), and its update notes by level. Design and contract: [ADR-477](../../v3/docs/adr/ADR-477-mod-toasts.md).

## Chat with Claude

Open it with `/ruflo chat` (menu: SWARM → start here; also the page tabs, the palette entry `view-chat` and the *Chat* link in the band).

- **What it shows.** The newest messages of *this* session, yours and Claude's. A reply that only used tools reads `… used <tools>`; the rows that only carry tool results are not shown. Long text is cut with `… cut`. At most 50 messages and 400 rows are drawn; the store behind it keeps 200. Every line is cleaned as on the AI terminal page: escape sequences, control, bidirectional and invisible characters are dropped and x.ruv.io invite codes are masked.
- **Live.** Claude's reply streams into the page as it is written, redrawn at most every 200 ms, while the page is open.
- **Sending.** Enter in the *Say something* field submits your text as a normal user turn, so the model reads it as your own words. The field empties once the message is taken. While Claude is busy the status reads `queued — sends when Claude is free`, and pressing Enter again does not send twice (it shows `already sending — wait for it`). A message that is not sent (refused, or declined by a hook) says so with a fixed `not sent: …` line that stays until your next send, and your text stays in the field to edit.
- **Secrets.** Secret-shaped text is refused and nothing is sent: by the AIDefence screen when it is on, by a local secret check when the screen is off or unavailable.
- **Every send is a normal, billed turn.** The console adds no model call of its own.
- **Privacy.** The conversation is read only while *Session preview* is on and the Chat page is open in the pane (plus one read when you open it). Nothing of it is written to disk, put into `console_state` text answers (they give counts only), sent to a model by the console, or shared by *Ask Claude about this view*. With *Session preview* off the page shows only a hint and reads nothing, not even the reply as it streams. The footer *Ask Claude* button is unchanged.

## Room and Mods

Open it with `/ruflo room` (menu: Safety → The Room).

- **Waiting for a yes**: the one confirm that is pending, with the seconds left to answer it.
- **Needs you, Sessions, Preview** (ADR-486): approvals, questions, failures and finished work across Claude Code, Codex and Ruflo sessions, including ones started outside Ruflo; the sessions grouped by repository and worktree; and a preview of the one you pick (latest response, current tool, edited files, test result, cost labelled reported, estimated or unavailable). Discovery is local and read-only: no model call, no process, nothing woken (the one write is a four-count summary ruflo-mods can show). The Sessions list starts folded; jumping to a session from the queue opens it. A finished session leaves the queue only after its preview was drawn; a session whose identity is ambiguous goes to an *unassigned* bucket and raises nothing. Transcript text is never saved, never sent to a model and never included in a text answer. Options `sessionWorkspace` and `sessionPreview` (both on).
- **The feed**: events, Claude's console actions and what you said, newest first. Filter by who, search, pause, page back. **⛔ blocked** shows only what was refused or failed: Claude's actions the control log marked denied or error, and events that say denied. Press a line to open it; an event that came from a page of its own (swarm, claims, learning, plugins, missions) offers a jump button to that page.
- **Mods**: one line per plugin mod that has written `.claude-flow/<name>-mod/status.json`. Press a line for its detail: what it guards (the file's own `summary`), guard, calls, blocked, the *class* of its last refusal (`secret`, `destructive`, `path`, `network`, `policy`, `other`; the refused text is never kept), `modVersion`, session start, last write, file age, and a stale marker when the last write was an earlier session.

A status file is data, not instructions: it is size-capped, shape-checked (`version: 1` only), and every string is stripped of control and bidi characters and cut to length before it is drawn. `summary`, `modVersion` and `lastDenied` are optional; a mod that does not write them shows "not reported".

## Project Anatole in Security & Doctor

An optional **Project Anatole** section on the Security & Doctor page (key `u`) lists, runs and edits the `ruflo-protector` mod (ADR-453). Without the plugin it is one line: `claude plugin install ruflo-protector@ruflo`.

- **Reads** `.claude-flow/protector-mod/status.json`, `rules.json` and the last 200 lines of `alerts.jsonl` through the bounded, regular-file-only reader (a file over 64 KB is refused; every field is whitelisted and cleaned). It is labelled *reported by the mod, unauthenticated*: any process can write those files.
- **Shows** the mode, the baseline's maturity ("learning 62%"), open alerts by severity, blocked and `degraded`; one row per rule (OWASP refs, severity, an off · notify · block chip, hits and acked share over the last 200 alerts, "changed from default"); the open alerts with `ack` and `allow`. The Findings meter counts open alerts, labelled as Anatole's.
- **Runs** `/protector run` and `/protector replay` into the page's Result panel.
- **Edits** the mode (off, learn, notify, enforce) and per-rule modes through `/protector`; every change asks first and its confirm row starts with `Effect:`. `enforce` is declared an install-class action and `reset-baseline` a delete-class one, so Claude's console tools always wait for you on both (palette ids `anatole-mode`, `anatole-rule`, `anatole-ack`, `anatole-allow`, `anatole-reset`, `anatole-run`, `anatole-replay`).
