# Truth Score Implementation

## Priority
**High** - Fixes 3 failing test suites

## Description
Implement truth score functionality to resolve 3 failing test suites identified during code validation.

## Background
During the recent code examination and validation process, 3 test suites were identified as failing due to missing or incomplete truth score implementation. This feature is critical for code quality verification and automatic rollback systems.

## Tasks
- [ ] Investigate the 3 failing test suites
- [ ] Implement missing truth score calculation logic
- [ ] Add truth score verification utilities
- [ ] Update tests to use proper truth score thresholds (0.95 accuracy)
- [ ] Ensure all test suites pass
- [ ] Add documentation for truth score usage
- [ ] Add examples of truth score implementation patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- All 3 failing test suites pass
- Truth score threshold maintains 0.95 accuracy minimum
- Code coverage remains above 80%
- Documentation includes usage examples
- No regressions in existing functionality
