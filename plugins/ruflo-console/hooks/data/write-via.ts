/**
 * The one place the console's disk writes are carried out, whatever the machine has. `writeVia(flavor, host, op)` runs one of the
 * enumerated operations: on Linux (`gnu`) and macOS/BSD (`posix`) it is exactly the fixed argv it always was (append-argv.ts, wf-file.ts,
 * write-flavor.ts), through `host.run` with the content on stdin; on Windows (`host-fs`), where none of dd, sh, install, mkdir or cp is on
 * the engine's PATH, it goes through the host's file API: `fs.read`, `fs.write` and `fs.exists`.
 *
 * What `host-fs` does, and where it differs:
 *  - The host's `fs.write` makes the folders and replaces the whole file, so a missing folder needs nothing ('create-dirs'), and an
 *    append is read-then-write of the whole text. Both the read and the write are refused past 4 MiB, so an append whose result would pass
 *    that is refused with a reason rather than cut; the callers that grow a file (the Events and Timeline files, the autopilot journal)
 *    rotate long before (2 MiB, 1 MiB, 1.5 MiB) exactly where they did with dd.
 *  - An append is not atomic: two consoles appending to one file at once can lose a batch (dd's O_APPEND kept both).
 *  - A target that is a link, or exists and is not a regular file (a folder), is refused as the sh scripts refuse it (exit 73).
 *  - An exclusive create or copy refuses a path where anything exists; it says so in the same words the pre-write check uses.
 *  - No file mode is set (Windows has none to set).
 * Never rejects on host-fs: a refusal is `{ exitCode: <non-zero>, stderr: <the reason> }`, like a command that exited non-zero.
